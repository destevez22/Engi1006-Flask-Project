The biggest thing I would change about my app is the style. I added certain elements that would 
enhance the visuals of my web app but refrained from getting too ambitious mostly due to time 
constraints. I definitely would want to implement CSS for some of the features I originally 
envisioned. I also hope there are no spelling mistakes that slipped by me!
